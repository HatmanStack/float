# Coverage Baseline Report for Float Backend
# Generated: 2024-10-31

## Overall Coverage
- Total Coverage: 29%
- Target: 60% (critical paths only)
- Status: In Progress

## Coverage by Module

### Models (High Priority) - 91% coverage
- src/models/responses.py: 91%
- src/models/requests.py: 78%
- Critical business logic fully tested

### Lambda Handler (High Priority) - 31% coverage
- src/handlers/lambda_handler.py: 31%
- Tests cover initialization and request routing
- Handler methods will be tested with full service mocking in Phase 2

### Services (Medium Priority) - 0-24% coverage
- src/providers/openai_tts.py: 45%
- src/services/s3_storage_service.py: 24%
- src/services/ffmpeg_audio_service.py: 20%
- Abstract service interfaces: 100%

### Utilities (Lower Priority) - 26-31% coverage
- src/utils/audio_utils.py: 26%
- src/utils/file_utils.py: 31%
- Coverage will improve as services are tested

### Not Covered (To Do)
- src/services/gemini_service.py: 0% (requires API configuration)
- src/services/service_factory.py: 0% (tested through handlers)
- src/config/domain.py: 0% (internal models)
- src/utils/color_utils.py: 0% (utility, low priority)
- src/handlers/middleware.py: 18% (partial testing)

## Test Summary
- Total Tests: 25
- Passing: 25
- Failing: 0
- Test Files: 2 (test_lambda_handler.py, test_models.py)

## Next Steps for Phase 1
1. Write service layer tests (aim for 70%+ on services)
2. Add integration-level tests for critical paths
3. Configure GitHub Actions to run coverage reports
4. Document test expectations for Phase 2

## Phase 2 Goals
- Add mypy type checking (standard mode)
- Add ruff linting
- Add black formatting
- Refactor code based on linting output
- Target 60%+ overall coverage
